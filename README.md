# Direct-Message-Sender

*To send some one any message on whatsapp and telegram we need to save his/her number to our contact atfist.*
*Here I make a solution for that. Now you don't need to save his/her contact to your mobile.*
*You can directly send message to any one on whatsapp and telegram without saving his/her contact.*

* For **whatsapp** you need the **number** of that person.
* For **telegram** you need the **username** of that person.

### Application Description :

* **We also don't need to open our app to open whatsapp. By selecting a number from outside of the app , we can directly open whatsapp.**

### My Implimentations  :

1. I have used **Intent** with **ACTION_VIEW** and also used whatsapp and telegram API to open whatsapp and telegram respectively.
2. I have used a third party library [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) to show GIF at ImageView.
3. I make a theme to make activity transparent.
4. I have implemented different themes for the ThumbTint of Switch drring check.
5. I have checked network state.

## Thank You
