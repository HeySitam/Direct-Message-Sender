# Direct-Message-Sender

*To send some one any message on whatsapp and telegram we need to save his/her number to our contact atfist.*
*Here I make a solution for that. Now you don't need to save his/her contact to your mobile.*
*You can directly send message to any one on whatsapp and telegram without saving his/her contact.*

* For **whatsapp** you need the **number** of that person.
* For **telegram** you need the **username** of that person.
